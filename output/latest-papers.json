      "title": "EventNeuS: 3D Mesh Reconstruction from a Single Event Camera",
      "summary": "Event cameras offer a considerable alternative to RGB cameras in many scenarios. While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To a...",

Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \\emph...",

Existing efficiency methods primarily rely on local, per-trajectory signals and lack principled mechanisms to exploit global dynamics across parallel branches. We introduce 2D probi...",
